# Superstore-Sales-SQL-Power-BI
This dataset provides information on a superstore located in the United States, including data on customers, product segments, product categories, and revenue. It can be used to analyze various aspects of the store's operations and customer behavior, such as popular products, customer demographics, and revenue trends.

In this project, SQL was used to run queries for analysis, and Power BI was utilized for creating visualizations.

It is important to note that the data consists of three tables, namely Orders, Returns, and People. The Orders table can be joined with the Returns table using common columns such as "Order ID" and "Product ID". However, the Returns table does not have any "Product ID" columns. The data was cleaned by joining both tables and removing the rows
